	<h1>Gimli</h2>
</header>
<p>Gimli is the son of Gloin, who was one of Bilbo's companions on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent.</p>

<p>Gimli was deemed too young to go on that journey, but 77 years later would find himself traveling with Bilbo's adopted heir, Frodo Baggins, on a quest of much greater importance.</p>

<p>Due to events in The Hobbit, Gimli held elves in contempt, but slowly over the course of The Lord of the Rings was able to embrace the pointy-eared race.</p>

<p>He is the only dwarf that ever sought the Undying Lands, which he did with his friend Legolas, desiring to see the fair Galadriel once more.</p>
