</header>
<p>Aragorn II was the son of Arathorn and Gilraen, and an only child. He was born on March 1st, 2931 of the Third Age, he was the thirty-ninth generation of the heirs of Isildur.</p>

<p>Aragorn was only two years old when his father was killed by trolls, so his mother took him to live in Rivendell. There, he was given the name Estel to hide his true identity and heritage because Sauron was searching to see if any heir of Isildur lived.</p>

<p>Estel often went out into the wild with Elrond's twin sons, Elladan and Elrohir. One day they returned, and it was said that Estel had done great things. Elrond decided that it was the time to tell him his true heritage. Elrond gave to Aragorn the tokens of his house, the Ring of Barahir and the Shards of Narsil.</p>

<p>The next day, Aragorn was walking in the woods of Rivendell when he met Arwen for the first time. He had been singing of Lúthien and thought that she had appeared to him. From that moment on he loved her.</p>

<p>Elrond could see what was in Aragorn's heart, and told him that he would have no wife until he had proved himself worthy, and that Arwen would live the life of the Elves as long as Elrond was in Middle-earth.</p>
