	<h1>Legolas</h2>
</header>
<p>Sindarin Elf of the Woodland Realm, son of Thranduil. In Third Age 3019 Legolas went to Rivendell as a messenger and took part in the Council of Elrond. He then became one of the Companions of the Ring, representing the Elves. In Lorien Legolas became very friendly with Gimli, a friendship which was maintained for the rest of their lives. After the breaking of the Fellowship, Legolas went with Aragorn and Gimli in search of Merry and Pippin, and they fought in the Battle of the Hornburg at Helm's Deep. He was one of the Grey Company, and fought in the Battle of Pelennor Fields. While in Southern Gondor Legolas for the first time saw the Sea, and the Eldarin yearning for Eldemar was awakened in him.</p>

<p>After the War of the Ring Legolas led a number of Elves of the Woodland Realm to Ithilien, where they beautified the war ravaged land. In Fourth Age 120, after the death of Elessar, Legolas finally sailed over Sea, taking Gimli with him.</p>
