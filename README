jQuery Manchester Meetup - 8th March

The code developed in this repository was used as an example to introduce some of the basic concepts of jQuery.

Within this, we look briefly at selectors, events, functions and basic ajax. This code is in now way recommended for commercial use, but as a testing ground for some of the basic opportunities that jQuery enables for us.
